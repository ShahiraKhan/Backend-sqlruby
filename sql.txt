SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT 
	OrderDetails.OrderID, 
	Products.ProductName, 
	OrderDetails.Quantity 
FROM 
	OrderDetails 
INNER JOIN
	Products 
ON 
	OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID;

(OR)

SELECT 
	OrdD.OrderID, 
	Prod.ProductName, 
	OrdD.Quantity 
FROM 
	OrderDetails AS OrdD 
INNER JOIN
	Products AS Prod 
ON 
	OrdD.ProductID = Prod.ProductID;



Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT 
	(Emp.FirstName || " " || Emp.LastName) AS EmployeeName, 
	OrdDet.ProductID, 
	OrdDet.Quantity 
FROM 
	Orders Ord 
INNER JOIN 
	OrderDetails OrdDet ON OrdDet.OrderID = Ord.OrderID 
INNER JOIN
	Employees Emp ON Emp.EmployeeID = Ord.EmployeeID 

(OR)

SELECT 
    (Emp.FirstName || " " || Emp.LastName) AS EmployeeName, 
    OrdDet.ProductID, 
    OrdDet.Quantity
FROM
    Orders Ord,
    OrderDetails OrdDet,
    Employees Emp 
WHERE
    OrdDet.OrderID = Ord.OrderID
AND
    Emp.EmployeeID = Ord.EmployeeID
